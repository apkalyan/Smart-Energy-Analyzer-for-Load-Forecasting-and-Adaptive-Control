# Smart-Energy-Analyzer-for-Load-Forecasting-and-Adaptive-Control

Modern power grids, especially at the residential and microgrid level, face growing challenges due
to unpredictable load patterns, limited infrastructure adaptability, and rising energy demands.
Traditional systems lack intelligent, decentralized decision-making capabilities—making them
inefficient during peak loads or grid fluctuations. This project addresses these challenges by
designing a Smart Grid Monitoring and Control System that integrates: Load Forecasting using
machine learning (LSTM – Long Short-Term Memory in our case) to anticipate future power
consumption, Adaptive Control via dynamic threshold-based load shedding—where the system can
automatically turn off non-essential loads based on real-time and forecasted power data. Built on
top of IoT(Internet of Things), edge computing, and machine learning, this system empowers users
with: Real-time power visualization, Configurable control over loads (manual/automatic),
Predictive insights to reduce wastage and prevent overloads and to aim for a future-ready, usercentric grid solution that’s smart, scalable.
